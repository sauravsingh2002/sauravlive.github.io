                    <P class="text-primary">Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is the integrated management of main
                        business processes, often in
                        real time and mediated by software and technology. ERP is usually referred to as a category of
                        business management software—typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization
                        can
                        use to collect, store, manage and interpret data from many business activities. ERP systems can
                        be
                        local based or cloud-based. Cloud-based applications have grown in recent years due to
                        information
                        being readily available from any location with Internet access. Traditional on-premises ERP
                        systems
                        are now considered legacy technology</P>
